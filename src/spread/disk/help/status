CALCULATION/INPUT ORDER
-----------------------
The order for entering data or calculations can be switched between
column and row. The default value can be changed with a configuration
program.


AUTO-CALCULATION ON INPUT
-------------------------
When on, the complete sheet is recalculated after each entry. c.f.:
Grid-Recalculate.


CURSOR-MOVE AFTER INPUT
-----------------------
The cursor can stay at the current cell (none), move down or right.


BACKUP FILE ON SAVE
-------------------
When activated, an existing file with the same filename is copied into
a backup file ending in _bak. An existing backup file is replaced.


CONFIRMATION REQUEST
--------------------
When selected you are asked for confirmation before any destructive
action (delete larger blocks, overwrite file) is performed.


LOCAL DIRECTORIES
-----------------
Allows you to change the directory, where QSpread data is stored, where
QSpread looks for printer and transfer filters, as well as the directory
containing this help information.


TOOLBAR
-------
This options allows you to switch the Toolbar off (and back on again, of
course), if you think your grid area is to small and you are desperatly
determined to use the space required by the toolbar.


GLOBAL UNITS
------------
This allows you to change the number format for new entries.

Negative numbers are usually represented by a leading minus sign,
positive number are shown as they are. The function "sign number
always" puts a plus sign in front of positive numbers.

Alternatively, the function "brackets when negative" put negative
values in brackets whereas positive values are left as they are.

The function "insert seperators" splits the integer part of a number
into blocks of three digits each seperated by a comma (,) for enhanced
readability. A configuration program can change the comma to an (').

The german speaking community requires a special numeric format,
because there is no decimal point, but a decimal comma, and digit
seperation is done via points. The function "german representation"
takes care of that.


GLOBAL MONETARY SYMBOL
----------------------
This allows to introduce a numeric value in the current range with a
new monetary symbol.


GLOBAL JUSTIFICATION
--------------------
This allows to display numeric values in the current range to be left-
or right justified.


FORMAT NUMBERS
--------------
The formatting of numbers can be suppressed if this is turned off.


ROUND DECIMAL PLACES
--------------------
The number of decimal places can be entered here. It determines how
exact the calculations are to be performed, and when numbers are to be
rounded. Rounding affects the results of calculations and I should
mention that from 0.5 incl. is rounded to the nearest upward number.


EMPTY IF ZERO
-------------
A cell with the numeric value zero can be left blank. This does not
affect the numeric value. The default value can be changed with a
configuration program.


EMPTY IF SAME AS ABOVE
----------------------
A cell with the numeric value of the cell above can be left blank. This
function has be included for long columns of data, where only values
are listed if they differ from the previous value. This does not affect
the numeric value. The default value can be changed with a
configuration program.


SET DIGIT NAMES
---------------
This function pulls down another window, where you can determin the
names used in the digit spelling function digit$. This allows you eg.
translations into other languages.
