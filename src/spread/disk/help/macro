USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS
----------------------
There are always formulae that are used quite often, and it is
unpleasant work to enter it all over again. The QSpread Fn's menu
provides a way of storing the often used formulae. When this menu is
activated, you see a list of (at present) 5 lines where formulae may be
stored. To enter a formulae in a slot, just select it with a DO. Now
you can enter the formula as usual (please remember that there is no
question mark pointer available here).

To activate a formula found in the functions menu, select it with a HIT
or press the according number key. When you move the pointer into the
grid window now, you see that it changed to an cross pointer. This
pointer shows you that a formula is brought into the next cell selected
with a HIT. To get back to the normal pointer without entering a user
defined function, just press the right mouse button.
