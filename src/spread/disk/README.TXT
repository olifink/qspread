Changes in QSPREAD 2003
=======================

Welcome to QSpread 2003. Please make sure that you run it with
the latest version of SMSQ/E V3.

If you run it under QDOS, please make sure you use the WMAN and
PTR_GEN which you find on this disk.

Please make sure that you use the latest version of MENU_rext!


If you run QSpread in MODE 4, you will not notice many visible changes.
As soon as you switch to 8 bit colours or higher, QSpread will look
totally different - MUCH better!
Look at the 3D style, and look at the icons (thanks to Phoebus
Dokos).

If you have not got it yet, get the SMSQ colour utility disk from
your dealer to choose between different themes and styles.
